# GA tuned Neural Net (Fruits classification dataset)
 Train a Deep Neural net to classify between a set of 4 fruits

 This program is in succession to the previous program which uses MNIST dataset.

 This program aims to train a Neural net to classify between a dataset containing 4 fruits.

 GA-parameters


 Size of population - 8

 Number of mating parents - 4

 Number of generations - 1000

 Mutation probability - 0.1%

 Crossover type - Mid-point Crossover



 Neural Network architecture

 Input layer - 120

 Hidden layer 1 - 150

 Hidden layer 2 - 60

 Output layer - 4



 Result
 The Neural Network reaches 99.3% training accuracy, which is a very good result considering the initial population size is just 8.

 This can be further improved by adding Convolutional layers to the network which will enhance its feature extraction capabilities.
